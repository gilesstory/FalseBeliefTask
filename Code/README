% FBT_runmodels.m: script that loops through different model configurations to fit, this calls FBT_fit.m
% FBT_fit.m: function to fit model to probabilistic false belief task data, with
%options for ML, MAP or mixed effects optimisation; calls emfit.m; uses parfor to run different subjects in parallel
% FBT_config.m: Function used to configure models and preprocess data, called by FBT_fit.m
% FBT_llfun.m: Main model objective function
